## Features

### üéØ **Core Functionalities**
- **Typing Test**: Type a randomly fetched paragraph to evaluate your typing speed and accuracy.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates:
  - **Words Per Minute (WPM)**.
  - **Accuracy (%)**.
  - **Time Taken (in seconds)**.
- **Live WPM Preview**: Real-time display of WPM as the user types.

### üìä **Leaderboard**
- Stores the top performers with:
  - **Name**.
  - **WPM**.
  - **Accuracy**.
- Displays the leaderboard in descending order of WPM.
- Allows viewing all records in a separate window.

### üé® **Modern UI/UX**
- Aesthetic **Black and Yellow Theme** for an engaging experience.
- Scrollable main screen for smaller screens to ensure accessibility.

### üìö **Dynamic Paragraphs**
- Fetches meaningful random paragraphs from an API.
- Fallback to a default paragraph if the API fails.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Difficulty Levels**
- Choose from:
  - **Easy**: Shorter paragraphs.
  - **Medium**: Moderate-length paragraphs.
  - **Hard**: Long paragraphs with advanced vocabulary.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Start the Test
- Launch the application and enter your **name** in the input field.
- Choose a **difficulty level**:
  - **Easy**: Shorter paragraphs with simple words.
  - **Medium**: Moderately lengthy paragraphs with a mix of simple and complex words.
  - **Hard**: Longer paragraphs with advanced vocabulary and sentence structures.
- A randomly fetched paragraph will be displayed based on the chosen difficulty.

---

### Step 2: Begin Typing
- Focus on the paragraph area and start typing as accurately and quickly as possible.
- The application starts the timer automatically when you begin typing.
- You can see a **live WPM preview** that updates as you type.

---

### Step 3: Submit Your Result
- Once you've finished typing the paragraph, click the **Submit** button.
- The application calculates and displays the following metrics:
  - **Time Taken**: The total time you spent typing the paragraph.
  - **Words Per Minute (WPM)**: Your typing speed in terms of words per minute.
  - **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly typed words compared to the original paragraph.

---

### Step 4: View Leaderboard
- Click on the **Leaderboard** button to see the top performances.
- The leaderboard displays:
  - **Name**: The name entered by the user.
  - **WPM**: Words per minute achieved.
  - **Accuracy**: Typing accuracy in percentage.
- The leaderboard is sorted by WPM in descending order to highlight the fastest typists.

---

### Step 5: Reset the Test
- Click the **Reset** button to start a new typing session.
- A new random paragraph will be fetched, and you can take the test again.
